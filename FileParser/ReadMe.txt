Solution for Art & Logic Programming Challenge Problem 2

This project provides the code that is the solution to 
problem 2 of the Art & Logic programming challenge.

This project provides a FileParserService class that 
can parse a file structured per the business rules 
of the problem and the populates a collection of
Section objects (see class Section) with the file's
contents.

The Section objects can then be manipulated 
to get specific values and to set specific 
values.

The FileParserService includes behavior to write 
formatted contents back to the a file.

See the unit tests (src/test/java) for examples
of how to use the FileParserService and Section
classes.
